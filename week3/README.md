## Database
> A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a manner that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and management. It serves as a repository for storing various types of information, such as text, numbers, images, multimedia files, and more.

## Design Pattern
> Design patterns are general reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design and development. They are not code or libraries but rather guidelines on how to structure code to solve specific problems efficiently. Design patterns help developers create software that is more flexible, maintainable, and scalable by providing proven solutions to recurring design challenges.

### Creational Design Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Examples include:
- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Method Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern

## REST API 
### HTTP 
> HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

1- **Http Properites**
- Statless
- Halÿ-duplex
- Client-driven
- Verbose

2- **HTTP Methods** : RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) to perform operations on resources. Each method has a specific purpose:
- GET: Retrieve a representation of a resource.
- POST: Create a new resource.
- PUT: Update an existing resource, or create a new resource if it doesn't exist.
- DELETE: Remove a resource.
- PATCH: Partially update a resource.
- HEAD: Retrieve metadata about a resource without fetching the entire representation.
- OPTIONS: Retrieve information about the communication options supported by a resource.
  
3- **HTTP Status Codes**: HTTP status codes indicate the outcome of an HTTP request. Common status codes used in REST APIs include:
- 200 OK: The request was successful.
- 201 Created: The resource was successfully created.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource does not exist.
= 400 Bad Request: The request is malformed or invalid.
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required.
- 403 Forbidden: Access to the resource is forbidden.
- 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

 4- **HTTP Headers**: HTTP headers contain additional metadata about the request or response. They can include information such as content type, content length, authentication tokens, caching directives, and more.
