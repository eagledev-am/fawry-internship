## Unit testing 
> Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. The goal is to verify that each unit of the software performs as expected. A "unit" is typically the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class.

## Design Pattern
> Design patterns are general reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design and development. They are not code or libraries but rather guidelines on how to structure code to solve specific problems efficiently. Design patterns help developers create software that is more flexible, maintainable, and scalable by providing proven solutions to recurring design challenges.

### Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that deal with object composition and the relationships between objects. These patterns help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same. They focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- Adapter Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
- Decorator pattern
