## Programming Paradigms ( Reactive programming )
> Reactive programming is a programming paradigm focused on designing systems that react to changes, such as user inputs, network responses, or data streams, in a timely and efficient manner. Instead of writing code that pulls or requests data at regular intervals, reactive programming allows the system to automatically respond to data as it becomes available.
