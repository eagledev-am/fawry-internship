- **Servlet**
  >Servlet is a Java program that runs on a server and is used to handle client requests, typically HTTP requests. Servlets are a key component of Java web applications and are commonly used to generate dynamic web content. They operate as the backend logic that processes the client's request, interacts with databases or other services, and generates a response, usually in the form of HTML, JSON, or XML.
