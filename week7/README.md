# Week 6
## JDBC and ORM ( hibernate )
- **JDBC**
  > a low-level API that allows Java applications to directly interact with relational databases. It provides a set of interfaces and classes to connect to a database, execute SQL queries, and process the results.
- **Hibernate**
  >  an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that abstracts much of the complexity of interacting with a database by allowing developers to work with Java objects instead of SQL statements.
